**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

There was one task in my previous work with the ethics component. There was a publicly available crime map with the exact coordinates of the committed crimes. The problem was that this is sensitive information to share even without the names of the participants because a) you can find out who lives/works at that location b) it can result in the reduced price of the property because some people can refuse to buy/rent property with the crime history. We discussed with my team the possible ways of solving this task so that no sensitive information would be shared and the map would remain informative. The solution was the following: we decided to place the crime on the closest crossroad to the exact location. It was not the simplest solution to implement, but this task showed me how crucial is ethics as a part of data analysis work.

Overall, I am convinced that every person working with data should be aware of such issues. It is not enough to just robotically apply some formulas to data and call it a day, because it can be truly damaging to people behind the data. It is just a part of the job to think about those people and ask yourself whether anything is off. And this can only be done by constantly educating yourself on such matters and listening to people around you. Statistics cannot be wrong, but the person who tries to apply it surely can.
